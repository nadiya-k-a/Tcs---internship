A side effect is an unwanted symptom caused by medical treatment. All medicines can cause side effects, including prescription, over-the-counter, and complementary medicines. This project aims to build a classification model that classifies the side effects of a particular drug by age, gender, and race. 
In recent years, the pharmaceutical industry has made significant strides in developing new drugs and therapies. However, side effects remain a considerable concern, affecting individuals across different age groups, genders, and races. Understanding the factors that contribute to the manifestation of these side effects is crucial for both healthcare professionals and the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the safety and efficacy of drug treatments. 
This project aims to build a classification model that can accurately classify the side effects of drugs based on demographic variables such as age, gender, and race. This model aims to provide valuable insights into the relationship between these factors and the occurrence of side effects, allowing for more targeted approaches to patient care and drug development.
